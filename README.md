"If you throw a lemon at me , I will make a lemonade of it". This quote sums up my career quite well. As an M.tech in Computer Science , I used to visualises my role as a strong support to the IT revolution in country. However, I felt my true calling in the field of educating the masses. This fervent passion made me take up computer education as my area of operation. During my tenure with Mahendras I not only handled academic assignments but also rendered key services in Admin &amp; Operations as well. This inculcated the art of managing an istitution within me and soon I was handed over key responsibilities at multiple centres across different states in country. moving through the streets of competitive examination, I never restricted my level of understanding to only government examination. The zeal to move in the management line made me join Career laumcher where I am currently handling key position as a centre manager . The zeal to touch greater heights tempt me to make dynamic contributions and willingness to learn never dies.
